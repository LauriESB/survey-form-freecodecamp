This is a repository made to upload my result of the first required project of FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.


## Goal

This first certification project requires completion of 5 initial courses. The objective was to build a website similar to >https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks< utilizing the knowledge acquired in the first 4 modules (basic HTML and CSS), aiming to meet all the tests requirements.
